# AI Coder Agent

This project uses [CrewAI](https://crewai.com) to create an autonomous Python developer agent.
The agent receives an assignment, plans a solution, writes the Python code, executes it, and verifies the results.
It is designed to automate repetitive coding tasks and generate structured outputs.

## Features
- Accepts assignments as input and generates working Python solutions
- Plans the approach before writing code
- Executes the code and captures the output
- Saves both code and output to a file
- Modular design for easy extension to
